# ASSIGNMENT-1
# Formation of Tables in HTML
A table is a structured set of data made up of rows and columns (tabular data). A table allows you to quickly and easily look up values that indicate some kind of connection between different types of data, for example a person and their age, or a day of the week, or the timetable for a local swimming pool.
Elements used to form a table are as follow:
<code>table</code> element is used to start to make a table
then <code>tr</code> element is used which indicate the table row and <code>td</code> is used which indicate the table data. Except these <code>tbody</code> <code>thead</code>
etc are used.

# Assignment-2
## Text Formation in Html
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text: <code>b</code> - Bold text. <strong> - Important text.<code>i</code>- Italic text. <code>em</code> - Emphasized text.
## Color in HTML
A <code>color</code> tag is an HTML element which specifies the color of something, such as text, a border, or a background. The use of the color tag in HTML is largely deprecated in favor of using stylesheets, but most browsers will recognize color tags when they are used in the HTML on a page.
## Background in HTML 
We can put background images colors in our webpage by using the <code>background-color</code> element and <code>backgrount-image</code> element and also maintain the position,layout and size of background.


# Assignment-3
# Formation of Buttons using HTML
The <code>button</code> element is used to create an HTML button. Any text appearing between the opening and closing tags will appear as text on the button. No action takes place by default when a button is clicked. Actions must be added to buttons using JavaScript or by associating the button with a form.

Formation of border using HTML 
The <code>border </code> property of  CSS sets an border of an element. It sets the value of <code>border-width</code> <code>border-color</code> <code>border-height</code> etc.

# Assignment-4
## Formation of diffrent parts of Website.

### 404:page not found
404 not found is a HTTP status code error that indicates the specific page you are trying to visit is non-existent. Usually, it occurs when the domain points to an incorrect DNS address, files or folders have misconfigured permissions, or the system runs a corrupt . htaccess file

### CTA section
A Call to Action (CTA) on a website is an instruction to the visitor in order to encourage them to take some kind of action. A Call to Action might be simple instructional text, such as “call us now”, “find out more”, or “subscribe to our Newsletter”.

### Hero section
A hero image is a website design term used to describe an oversized banner image at the top of a website. Sometimes called a “hero header”, it serves as a user's first glimpse of your company and offering because of its prominent placement towards the top of a webpage that usually extends full-width.

### Navigation bar
A navigation bar is a link to appropriate sections/pages in a website that helps readers in traversing the online document. Considered a traditional method of navigation, a navigation bar can be implemented in a number of ways, namely, horizontally or vertically, or fixed or dynamic. A navigation bar implementation is considered one of the key points of Web design and usability.

 # OBJECT:  HTML Elements.
 ## Make a webpage with the following html elements:
Nested order and unorder list<br>
semantics tags for the layout<br>
text formatting tags<br>
image, video and audio<br>
iframe<br>

# THEORY:
## Nested order and unorder list
We have to use an <codeul></code> or <code>ol</code> tag to describe the order of the list. For creating an unordered list, we usre the ultag,while for creating an ordered list we use,<code> ol</code> tag.
After that<code> li</code> is used to list the items
## semantics tags for the layout
Semantic HTML refers to syntax that makes the HTML more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout of web pages. It makes web pages more informative and adaptable, allowing browsers and search engines to better interpret content. Some of symantics tag are: <code>header</code> <code> footer </code> <code>nav</code> <code>span </code>

## text formatting tags
What is the use of formatting tag in HTML? The formatting can be used to set the text styles (like – bold, italic, or emphasized, etc.), highlighting the text, making text superscript and subscript, different formatting tags in HTML are <code>b</code> and <code>strong</code> etc. Both tags are used to make the text bold.

## image, video and audio
To embed audio in HTML, we use the <code>audio</code> tag.To embed video in HTML, we use the<code> video </code>tag.To embed image in HTML, we use the <code>img</code> tag.

## iframe
<code>iframe</code> tag is used to put any link on the webside.
# CODES:

# CONCLUSION:
In this way we can make format our text, manage the margin and put image, audio, video and link in the website.

# OBJECTIVE: Flow layout and Positioned layout in CSS.
# THEORY:
## Flow layout :
Normal Flow, or Flow Layout, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout. In normal flow, inline elements display in the inline direction, that is in the direction words are displayed in a sentence according to the Writing Mode of the document. Block elements display one after the other, as paragraphs do in the Writing Mode of that document.
## Positioned Layout:
A positioned element is an element whose computed <code>position </code>value is either <code>relative</code>,<code> absolute</code>, <code>normal</code>, or <code>sticky</code>. (In other words, it's anything except static.) A relatively positioned element is an element whose computed <code>position</code> value is <code>relative</code>. The <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code> properties specify the vertical offset from its normal position; the <code>left</code> and <code>right </code> properties specify the horizontal offset. An absolutely positioned element is an element whose computed position value is absolute or <code>fixed</code>. The <code>left</code> <code>right </code> <code>bottom</code>  <code>top</code> properties specify offsets from the edges of the element's containing block. (The containing block is the ancestor relative to which the element is positioned.) If the element has margins, they are added to the offset. The element establishes a new block formatting context (BFC) for its contents. A stickily positioned element is an element whose computed position value is<code> sticky</code>. It's treated as relatively positioned until its containing block crosses a specified threshold (such as setting top to value other than auto) within its flow root (or the container it scrolls within), at which point it is treated as "stuck" until meeting the opposite edge of its containing block.
# CODES:
# CONCLUSION:
In this way we can manage the layout in webpage.
